HOW TO WORK WITH 5GT-SO
------------------------------

Requirements
============
* Python 3.5.2+
* pip3
* osm python lib

* MongoDB, just running, no configuration needed.
* A MANO platform running at your computer. Current supported MANO platforms are: OSM and Cloudify 
  * OSM R3, R4 or R5. Full support for OSM R3. 
      OSM R3 installation guide: https://osm.etsi.org/wikipub/index.php/OSM_Release_THREE
      OSM R4 installation guide: https://osm.etsi.org/wikipub/index.php/OSM_Release_FOUR
      OSM R5 installation guide: https://osm.etsi.org/wikipub/index.php/OSM_Release_FIVE
  * Cloudify. Version 4.5 or above.
      Cloudify installation guide: https://docs.cloudify.co/4.5.0/install_maintain/installation/manager-image/
      After Cloudify installation open Cloudify Dashboard and choose Cloudify Catalog-> Plugins Catalog 
      press download OpenStack plugin

    Cloudify plugin for MTP it is still in testing phase and it will be provided when ready. 

* If you are running the 5GT-SO with OSM you need an available OpenStack instance.
* Currently, if you are running the 5GT-SO with Cloudify you need an available OpenStack instance.

Install
=======

git clone https://5g-transformer.eu/git/5g-transformer.5gt-so

* In folder /5GT-SO execute pip3 install -r requirements.txt  # only the first time, to install required libraries

* To install osm python lib:
  from folder 5GT-SO/coreMano/osmclient/
  run:
	sudo python3 setup.py install
  NOTE: 1) this library was downloaded from https://osm.etsi.org/gerrit/osm/osmclient.git on date 09/28/2018
        and the following files were modified:
        scripts/osm.py
        sol005/ns.py
        v1/ns.py
        2) If you use OSM, you need to register your Openstack instance. This can be done easily with the client and it is explained in the OSM Rx installation guide previously
           referred


Configuration files
===================
Check values in the following configuration files:

5GT-SO/mtp.properties
    -> to configure the mtp properties
5GT-SO/db/db.properties
    -> to configure the mongo db properties
5GT-SO/coreMano/coreMano.properties
    -> to configure the required parameters for the MANO platform (either OSM or Cloudify)
5GT-SO/sm/rooe/rooe.properties
    -> to configure the parameters of the running PA. PA runs as a separate server from the 5GT-SO, thus, it has to be previously launched
5GT-SO/monitoring/monitoring.properties
    -> to configure the required parameters for the monitoring and the sla-manager modules of the 5GT-SO
5GT-SO/sm/soe/vs.properties 
    -> to configure the 5GT-VS instances considered as possible requesters within the local domain
5GT-SO/sm/soe/federation.properties
    -> to configure the IP address of the possible federated domains


Prerequisites (before running)
====================
* 5GT-SO runs with IFA 014 descriptors and MANO platform dependant descriptors. The Network Service Descriptors (NSDs) and its constituent VNF descriptors 
   need to be available to be instantiated. 
   IFA descriptors are needed both for VNFs and the NSD. The IFA descriptors can be onboarded at the SM with the NBI following the IFA013 procedure.
   MANO platform dependant descriptors are generated automatically (translation from IFA descriptors) and onboarded at the corresponding MANO platform 
   to be able to instantiate the different available Network Services.

Usage
=====
To run the server, execute the following from the "5GT-so/nbi/python-flask-server" directory:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt  # only the first time
python3 -m swagger_server

by open your browser to here:

http://localhost:8080/5gt/so/v1/ui/

you can check all NBI operations definitions and test them.

At http://localhost:8080, the user can find the GUI, which supports the defined workflows of the 5GT-SO. The 5GT-SO_User_Guide.docx file in this folder
explain all the details of the GUI and all the features supported by the 5GT-SO.
