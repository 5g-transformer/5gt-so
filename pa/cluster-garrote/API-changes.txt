cluster-matching/src/graph_interactions.py::create_hosts_graph()
 - host['free_capabilities'] does not exist anymore, the API object has 'available_capabilities'
 - host_edge['free_capacity'] does not exist anymore, the API considers ['capacity']['total']
   and ['capacity']['available']


Expected things from FRANCESCO clustering:
 + inside PARequest['nfvi']['NFVIPoPs'][1]['cluster']
   to indicate to which cluster the NFVI PoP is associated
